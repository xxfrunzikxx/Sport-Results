Sport-Results
=============
Quick Description: XML parser + "Big Data"
=========================

Task Description

Create a program that reads an XML file which contains sport results.

3 extracted files shall be generated from the XML-file.

● The data files contains both Swedish and English names – use the English ones.

● The data files sometimes contains several “Score” elements use “current” one

● If “Score” is missing - do not use them i.e the game has not yet started.

File 1: Match list – alphabetically ordering (big-matchlist-alphasort.txt)

File 1 shall include a list of all matches specified in the XML. One row for each match according to:

Sport | Category | Tournament | Team1Name - Team2Name : Team1Score - Team2Score

The rows in the file must be sorted alphabetically (A-Ö).

Example:

Soccer | Australia | Hyundai A-League | Wellington Phoenix FC - Melbourne Victory : 2 - 0

Soccer | England | Premier League | Blackpool FC - Birmingham City : 5 - 1

Soccer | England | Premier League | Fulham FC - West Bromwich Albion : 4 - 1

File 2: Match list – Sorted on number of goals (big-matchlist-goalsort.txt)

This file shall include the same information as in “Match list” – alphabetically, but must also be sorted on number of goals in each game, greatest number first and so on. I.e a closing result of 5-2 is a total of 7 goals.

Example:

Soccer | England | Premier League | Blackpool FC - Birmingham City : 5 - 1

Soccer | England | Premier League | Fulham FC - West Bromwich Albion : 4 - 1

Soccer | Australia | Hyundai A-League | Wellington Phoenix FC - Melbourne Victory : 2 - 0

File 3: Top list (big-toplist.txt)

This file shall include a “Top list” – the most common starting letter in the goal scoring teams name. All letters with 1 or more goals shall be listed, sorted greatest to least.

Example:

Taken the matches from above example:

B: 6

F: 4

W: 3

Execution:

  You must use Java

  Any use of 3rd party libraries is OK

  Not neccesary to package the software, the importat thing is that it can be run in the dev environment.
